				<h1>About COVID</h1>
				<br></br>
                <h2>What is COVID</h2>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a> is a serious issue right now. COVID-19 or Coronavirus is a virus that causes extreme flu-like symptoms and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coronavirus is spread through breathing in “respiratory droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes.” As of September 18, 2020, there have been 28.6 million cases worldwide, while 19.3 million have recovered, 917 thousand have died.

				<h2>How COVID affects friends and family</h2>
				This pandemic has caused major changes worldwide and have led to statewide mask mandates and a worldwide quarantine. Many people are facing several new issues that they would not have encountered otherwise.
				<br></br>
				<h2>How COVID affects me</h2>
				Coronavirus had forced Indiana schools to close down in early 2020 and adapt a hybrid schedule for fall that year. Online schooling is difficult because many school systems and parents were not prepared for the transition to computers. Many students who were unfamiliar with online programs suffered. Online schooling and the quarantine led to many lonely months without seeing my friends. When I was able to see my friends again, we were able to hang out again, we could only go to parks and wore masks.
				<br></br>
				<h2>Symptoms to look out for</h2>
				Some symptoms of Coronavirus include Fever or chills, Coughing, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Fatigue, Muscle or body aches, Headache, New loss of taste or smell, Sore throat, Congestion or runny nose, Nausea or vomiting, and Diarrhea.

				<h2>Where to find help</h2>
				If you think you have Coronavirus, seek out help and go to your local pharmacy or hospital to be tested. If you test positive, make sure to let everyone you’ve been near in the last few weeks know and self quarantine.
